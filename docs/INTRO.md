This project contain a group of [Terraform](http://terraform.io) modules that will act as an unit to provide you with the needed resources for your projects.

If you need to build the network infrastructure to run your instances in, you can use the [network](https://github.com/moltin/terraform-stack/tree/master/aws/network) module which will create a VPC, subnets, NAT gateway and internet gateway for you.

> Note: If you are looking for simpler modules that accomplish a single responsibility we built as well [terraform-modules](https://github.com/moltin/terraform-modules)

This project has been highly inspired by the work of others that have decided to share with the community their work, check the [resources](#resources) section for more info.
